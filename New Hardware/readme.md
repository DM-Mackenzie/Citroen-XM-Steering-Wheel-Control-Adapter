# PCB Design

There are some things to consider for PCB design:
1. Enclosure; the enclosure must be preferably made to hold a PCB, and must not be 3D Printed but fabricated, suitable for use in an automotive environment (mostly extreme temperatures)
2. Automotive compliant power supply; due to the "dirty" nature of automotive 12 volt supplies (voltage spikes, ripple) Power supply IC's are made for use in this environment
3. Suit the 7 pin connector with spade connectors
4. Allow for 3.5mm output, so the user can get any 3.5mm cable
5. Fuse on board, for protection
6. Block screw connectors for power supply cables
