# Citroën XM Steering Wheel Control Adapter
This project contains a steering wheel control adapter, to make the existing buttons on the steering wheel of a Citroën XM work with modern headunits, in this case a Pioneer headunit. Project goals are:

1. Use a modern head-unit in the car without cutting cables or soldering resistors inside the steering-wheel PCB's
2. Be able to select different profiles in the code for different brands (For now at least Pioneer and Sony)
3. Have additional detection for possible extra functions; double press - and long press detection. (Siri commands, call, etc.)
4. LED's inside the original buttons must work
5. Clearly show build-up and functionality of existing SWC
6. Code and PCB can be easily understood and adapted by others

The code and project is created with an Atmel328p in mind (like in the Arduino Uno) but will probably work (with minor adaptions) on other boards.
