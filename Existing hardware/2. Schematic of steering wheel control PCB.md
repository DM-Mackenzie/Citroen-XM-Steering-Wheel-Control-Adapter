# Schematic of SWC PCB
This is a schematic of how the original SWC PCB's are built up, and their components. As you can see, in theory you would be able to press multiple buttons at once and create a different voltage as a result. Therefore the analogRead() needs to have some tolerance, but not too much to allow this behavious.
